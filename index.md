Hello! I am a Ph.D student from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) workig on wireless networking, under the supervision of [Dr. Vincent Wong](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~vincentw/). I received my B.Eng in Honours Electrical Engineeinrg from [McGill University](www.mcgill.ca) in 2014, and a M.A.Sc in electrical and computer engineering from the Univerisity of British Columbia in 2016. For my Ph.D work, I primarily work on machine learning and deep reinforcement learning-based scheduling algorithm design in wireless networking, with an emphasis on optimizing the freshness of data in heterogneous caching networks. 

Here is a list of projects I have worked on during my graduate studies:

### Speed of Sound Estimation and Correction in Dual Stage Ultrasound

During my Master's study, I developed an speed-of-sound (SOS) estimation and correction method that improves the spatial resolution of biomedical ultrasound. For more details see [Dual Stage SoS](dual_stage_sos).
