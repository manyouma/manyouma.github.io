Hello! I am a Ph.D student from the University of British Columbia workig on wireless networking, under the supervision of Dr. Vincent Wong. I received my B.Eng in Honours Electrical Engineeinrg from McGill University in 2014, and a M.A.Sc in electrical and computer engineering from the Univerisity of British Columbia in 2016. For my Ph.D. work, I primarily work on in scheduling problems in wireless networking, with an emphasis on machine learning and deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms design. 

Here is a list of projects I have work on during my graduate studies:

### Speed of Sound Estimation and Correction in Dual Stage Ultrasound

During my Master's study, I developed an speed-of-sound (SOS) estimation method. I improves the spatial resolution of biomedical ultrasound imaging by performing speed of sound estimation and correction. For more details see [Dual Stage SoS](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~manyoum/dual_stage_sos/).
